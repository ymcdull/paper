STUCCO:(search and testing for understandable consistent contrasts)
Contrast set-mining    sales|Ph.D sales|Bachelor

We propose a novel group difference detection algorithm named DIFF that uses the prefix-tree structure to compress the search space,
follows a tree traversal procedure to discover the complete set of group differences, and employs efficient
pruning strategies to expedite the search process.

DIFF superior ot STUCCO

decision-tree building process often follows a greedy rule

the compo-
nents (or items) of a contrast set can be feature-
value pairs (e.g., age > 45, income = high) and simple
items/products (e.g., long-term service plan, history
book). 


1.Contrast Set Mining
2.Emerging Pattern Discovery
others:Decision-tree induction, association rule mining

The main difference between emerging patterns
and contrast sets is that contrast sets measure an ab-
solute difference, and emerging patterns measure a
relative difference (i.e., P (item set group 1) − P (item
set group 2) versus P (item set group 1)/P (item
set group 2)).



Group difference 

min_dif -- absolute difference
min_ratio  -- relative difference

find all the significant group differences


Part 4
Theorem 2. The support of a node is not greater than the support of its parent node.

Compared to Han et al. (2004), we consider
multiple groups and multiple users; thus, the calcula-
tion of support incorporates users (Definition 1), and
each group has its own tree. If there is only one group
and one user, the tree built is the same as an FP
tree.


Conclusion:
group difference detection
more general definition and better method

减小min_dif,增加min_ratio,最终取top-k
